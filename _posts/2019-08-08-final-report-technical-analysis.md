###Purpose and Data Set
I chose to work with stock data because I thought that it would be interesting to use machine learning
techniques with data that is already primarily in numerical format. I was inspired by youtubers who used
advanced machine learning techniques and automated trading to make money from currencies in videogames,
cryptocurrencies, and foreign currency exchanges. 

###Data Prepossessing
This project uses data collected from Yahoo Finance about Alphabet (GOOG) stock from August 1st of 2004 
(08/01/2004) when the company was founded until July 10th of 2019 (07/10/2019). Only information provided 
from the free version of Yahoo Finance was used. When downloading data from [Yahoo Finance](https://www.yahoo.com/finance) 
it is downloaded as a comma separated value file (".csv" extension). I chose to manually separate the testing and training
data. This was done because late into the project it became apparent that using all previous days information to predict
the next day was overfitting. Dr. Clark advised that I should some number <i>n</i> where only the <i>n</i> preceding day's
value is used to predict the next day’s value. This number of days led to a lot of time being spent on re-splitting the data
because the number of days it should see before were modified. Getting the data into the program was easy with PANDAS.
PANDAS is a great library with a built-in converter from CSV files to a PANDAS DataFrame data type. From these DataFrames
it is much easier to access and manipulate columns and rows. Once the data had been converted, I used the Sci-Kit learn
prepossessing library to normalize the data using min max scaling.

###Version Control
Because the data was such a pain to split up I tried to change the number of previous inputs 
as few times as possible. One tool that allowed me to work on the same data at home and while I was working
an office job was Git. The computers at my work were locked down and I was unable to use IPython or Jupytr
but I could use Git for windows. After a few times cloning, branching, committing and pulling it gets easier. This 
technology helped a lot and assured that I always had access to my most up-to date code.

###Building the Model with Keras
I wanted to work with TensorFlow but found the library was too cumbersome and technical. I stumbled across Keras which
is a popular data science library that has been written on top of TensorFlow. The power of this library is that it includes
simple and concise APIs that reflect what is happening at a logical or abstract level. To this end, any errors that Keras
comes across are easily debuggable because Keras has extremely helpful error messages, sometimes even recommending changes.
Once I completed a simple regression model based only on one data feature (for 15 days) and was satisfied with my results,
adding another set of features or adding a layer can typically be accomplished in less than 5 lines of code. Keras managing
so much information allowed me to really focus on getting a working model. The model that I built took 15 previous days 
stock opening price and used this to predict the next closing price. Essentially predicting what the market should close
at for the current day. 


###Results

Training for 15 days to predict the next day using only one layer, which is a simple regression model, yielded accuracy
around 70 to 90 percent. One thing that still confuses me is that the number of Epochs, or number of times the model is 
trained, had no impact on the accuracy. I played with adding layers to the model to make it a neural network but the
improvements were trivial. The only thing that I found that gave me consistently better results was using the Adam
optimization technique, described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980v8) instead of the Stochastic Gradient 
Descent optimization approach. I would be lying if I said I really understood the difference between the two but I
wanted to play with how the model was being optimized to see what kind of results I could get. After researching it appears
that maybe this technique is more computationally taxing and that is why it provides better results.


###What I Learned
When I started this course, I thought that I knew a lot more than I did. I thought that I could improvise around what I did
not fully understand using libraries as a crutch. In my head I wanted to defeat this view, but I found that my progress at
first was slow. I had to figure out a model to use and fix the data to my liking. Both tasks took serious amounts
of time. When I first started looking at TensorFlow documentation I was completely lost. I thought that maybe PyTorch
would be a good alternative but after looking at many alternatives I decided to give one called Keras a try. After the
project looking back my outlook seems naive. AI/machine Learning is already so complicated that people build these tools
to make others’ lives easier when they want to use these techniques to solve a problem. This sounds obvious but I think 
that this has really changed my viewpoint as a programmer. I think that in the future I would like to try to contribute 
to an open source project that I use.
